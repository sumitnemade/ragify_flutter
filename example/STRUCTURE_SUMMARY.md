## 🚀 **Key Improvements Made**

### **1. ✅ Real Flutter Applications**
- **Before**: Console scripts that couldn't run in Flutter
- **After**: Complete Flutter apps with Material Design UI
- **Result**: Developers can actually run and use these examples

### **2. ✅ Proper Package Integration**
- **Before**: Examples couldn't import the RAGify package
- **After**: Each example properly imports `package:ragify_flutter/ragify_flutter.dart`
- **Result**: Developers see how to use the package in real Flutter apps

### **3. ✅ Working Examples**
- **Before**: Examples were just code snippets
- **After**: Interactive Flutter apps with real functionality
- **Result**: Developers can test features and understand usage patterns

### **4. ✅ Flutter Package Conventions**
- **Before**: Wrong structure for a Flutter package
- **After**: Follows Flutter package example conventions
- **Result**: Package is now properly structured for Flutter developers

./run_example.sh
```
Then select the example you want to run from the menu.

### **Option 2: Direct Flutter Commands**
```bash
# From root directory
flutter run -d chrome example/basic_usage/lib/main.dart
flutter run -d chrome example/advanced_features/lib/main.dart
flutter run -d chrome example/full_integration/lib/main.dart
```

### **Option 3: From Example Directory**
```bash
cd example/basic_usage
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Package Import**
Each example properly imports the RAGify package:
```dart
import 'package:ragify_flutter/ragify_flutter.dart';
```

### **Local Development**
Examples use `path: ../` in pubspec.yaml for local development:
```yaml
dependencies:
  ragify_flutter:
    path: ../
```

### **Real Flutter Apps**
